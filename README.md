# Flutterwave Home Page Clone

It was a project to imitate the flutterwave [home page](https://flutterwave.com/ng) and [payment links](https://flutterwave.com/payment-links) which was done also with the routing exhibition.\
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tools Used

- TypeScript
- React

## Installation

The Node Package Manager to install React Typescript.

```bash
npx create-react-app flutterwave --template typescript
```

## Usage

Copy the URL from [@trinitycodez](https://github.com/trinitycodez/flutterwave.git). Clone the repository from your terminal with this command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trinitycodez/flutterwave.git
```

## Available Scripts or commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This can be written in the terminal to run the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser or wait for it to automatically display on your default browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see some lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
